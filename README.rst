tf-idf
=======================

A TF-IDF implementation for python3.

Features
----

 - stopwords
 - ngrams of arbitrary size
 - word stemming
 - ability to return keywords as original text or normalized
    (stemmed, stopwords removed) ngrams


Development
-----------

To begin development, execute `pip install -e .[dev,test]`. This will install all required
testing and development packages. Additionally you will want to run the unit testing
suite - this should be as simple as `pytest`, but more on that in a future update.
